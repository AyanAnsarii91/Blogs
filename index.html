            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology is the heartbeat of modern life, shaping the way we
                communicate, work, learn, and connect. From smartphones and AI to renewable energy and space
                exploration, it continuously evolves to solve real-world problems and improve human experience. It
                bridges distances, automates tasks, and opens doors to innovations once thought impossible. But with its
                power comes responsibility—to use it ethically, inclusively, and sustainably. As technology grows
                smarter, it doesn’t just change tools; it transforms societies. In this digital age, staying curious and
                adaptable is key, because the future belongs not just to those who use technology, but to those who
                understand it.
